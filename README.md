# Geo-Location-Compression-using-Wavelet-Key-Compression
This work involved compressing latitudes &amp; longitudes data data using the Daubechies wavelet transform. The idea involves in transforming the data into the wavelet domain and storing the numbers at which the coefficient exists. This is known as the key vector. The latitude and longitude data was taken from GeoLife Trajectories dataset made by Microsoft.
